Well heres the thing a me and a bunch of strangers got 6 players (miniumn) to play Quarter quell. The arena loaded fine but the
tick tock goes clock did not start all the disasters but sent us straight to death match.
Well it just whent all downhill from there as the lighting would alwasy attack you no matter where you stand.
Please fix this problem as i actually really enjoy quarter quell and im sure many others would if it was not broken and if people
new it was avaliable or what it was.
